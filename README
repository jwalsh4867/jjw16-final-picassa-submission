Started 1/23. Finished 2/8 
Total time spent working on project: ~18 hours. Ran into a lot of small problems with debugging which resulted from simple mistakes. Also changed my overall design several days into the project. I decided I preferred the template method. 
Student consulted: none. Only consulted Prof. Hewner and my TA. 
Materials used: GOF book, head first book and lectures.
Impressions: At first I had trouble applying what we had learned in lecture to Picassa primarily because they were resonably different and I found the GOF book hard to comprehend. After the template lecture and once I borrowed a friends head first book, the task became much easier. Unfortunately this help came a little too late.
